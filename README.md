# The Cadman Font

This font has been designed to be as legible as possible. There is a lot of opinion on the Internet about which fonts are suitable for dyslexic peole and much of its contradictory.
This is only to be expected, people are different from one another and what is suitable for one is not suitable for all.

However there are some characteristics which are commonly accepted as making a font more suitable for use by dyslexic people.

• Good ascenders and descenders

• Wide apertures

• Lowercase **b** and **d** distinguished from each other not just mirrored

• Lowercase **p** and **q** distinguished from each other not just mirrored

• Different forms for capital/uppercase **I**, lowercase **l** and digit **1**

• Rounded **g** and rounded **a** as in handwriting

• Lowercase **r** and **n** together (**rn**) should not look like **m**

Cadman is suitable wherever a clear and legible sans serif font is required. It has **Bold**, *Italic* and ***Bold Italic***.
There are many OpenType features including small capitals, fractions and ordinals.
There are two stylistic alternatives which change the digit zero from dotted to slashed zero or blank zero.

Cadman contains a Greek alphabet suitable for mathematics and many Mathematical Operators, Cyrillic alphabet, Canadian Aboriginal Syllabics, Letterlike Symbols, Miscellaneous Symbols, and Dingbats.

**Cadman is both free for both Commercial and Non-Commercial use.**
